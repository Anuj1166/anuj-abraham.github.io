      <p>
        I am an experienced researcher in Control Engineering, Artificial Intelligence,
        Computer Vision, and Smart Mobility. My work focuses on intelligent transportation
        systems, autonomous vehicles, AI-driven perception, and real-time deployment. This 
        encompasses the use of modeling and control to solve science and engineering problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently a <b>Research Associate at IIT Goa</b>, working on
        AI-driven marine species identification and smart mobility systems. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My research interests are in the area of systems & control with a strong 
        background in the modeling of complex systems, optimization, & control of 
        a large-scale system with applications to intelligent transportation systems, 
        autonomous systems, and process control & instrumentation. I have several 
        years of expertise in the field of control engineering and smart mobility. 
        I am skilled in traffic simulation, control theory, C, C++, Robot Operating 
        System (ROS), MATLAB, VISSIM, and VTD. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my Ph.D. in the faculty of Electrical engineering at Anna University, 
        Chennai-India in February 2017. Moreover, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at Energy 
        Research Institute@NTU (ERIAN) and Smart Mobility Experience Lab (SMEL) of the 
        School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the Nanyang Technological 
        University (NTU) in Singapore (2017–2019). I am a recipient of the Anna Centenary
        Research Fellowship (ACRF) for 3 years (2012-2015) and a scholarship for an exchange 
        Ph.D. - 6 months mobility period at University of Pardubice, Czech Republic through 
        Erasmus Mundus Action 2 (EMA2) Svaagata.eu project (2014-2015). 
        I have teaching experience of more than 5 years as Assistant Professor in the Department 
        of Applied Electronics & Instrumentation at the Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology 
        (RSET), APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) in Kerala- India. 
        Additonally, served as Guest Lecturer at Anna University, Chennai-India for 1.5 years.
